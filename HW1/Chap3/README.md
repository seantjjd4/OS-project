# UNIX Shell and History Feature
* This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process
* Part I - Creating a child process to execute a command
    * The first task is to modify the main() function is Fig. 3.35 so that a child process is forked and executes the command specified by the user.
* Part II - Creating a history feature
    * The next task is to modify the shell interface program so that it provides a history feature that allows the user to access the most recently entered commands.
